\subsection{Detailed Description}
I couldn\textquotesingle{}t find any tutorial on how to perform face recognition using Open\+C\+V and Java, so I decided to share a viable solution here. The solution is very inefficient in its current form as the training model is built at each run, however it shows what\textquotesingle{}s needed to make it work.

The class below takes two arguments\+: The path to the directory containing the training faces and the path to the image you want to classify. Not that all images has to be of the same size and that the faces already has to be cropped out of their original images (Take a look here \href{http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/jg/nui07/index.html}{\tt http\+://fivedots.\+coe.\+psu.\+ac.\+th/$\sim$ad/jg/nui07/index.\+html} if you haven\textquotesingle{}t done the face detection yet).

For the simplicity of this post, the class also requires that the training images have filename format\+: $<$label$>$-\/rest\+\_\+of\+\_\+filename.\+png. For example\+:

1-\/jon\+\_\+doe\+\_\+1.\+png 1-\/jon\+\_\+doe\+\_\+2.\+png 2-\/jane\+\_\+doe\+\_\+1.\+png 2-\/jane\+\_\+doe\+\_\+2.\+png ...and so on.

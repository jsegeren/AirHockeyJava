\item Enhanced {\ttfamily F\+Fmpeg\+Frame\+Recorder} to support conversion between audio sample formats (for the experimental A\+A\+C encoder among other things) and to let two different threads call {\ttfamily record(samples)} and {\ttfamily record(image)} simultaneously, plus a couple of other features like {\ttfamily set\+Frame\+Number()}, which lets users skip image frames (achieving variable frame rate)
\item Added a {\ttfamily javacpp.\+skip} property to {\ttfamily pom.\+xml}, such that a command like {\ttfamily mvn package -\/\+Pall -\/\+Djavacpp.\+skip=true} only recompiles the Java source files, but also added {\ttfamily platform.\+root} and {\ttfamily compiler.\+path} properties, which map directly to Java\+C\+P\+P\textquotesingle{}s for convenience

\item Made it easier to create one massive statically linked native library by passing something like \char`\"{}-\/\+Xcompiler -\/\+Wl,-\/static -\/o javacv\char`\"{} as command line options to Java\+C\+P\+P, usually from inside {\ttfamily build.\+xml} or {\ttfamily pom.\+xml} (issue \#146)
\item Fixed missing parameter from {\ttfamily Cv\+A\+N\+N\+\_\+\+M\+L\+P.\+create()}
\item Added methods {\ttfamily cv\+Calc\+Covar\+Matrix\+Ex()}, {\ttfamily cv\+Eigen\+Decomposite()}, and {\ttfamily cv\+Eigen\+Projection()} taking an {\ttfamily Ipl\+Image\mbox{[}\mbox{]}} as argument for convenience
\item {\ttfamily Video\+Input\+Frame\+Grabber.\+start()} now accepts a {\ttfamily connection} argument such as {\ttfamily V\+I\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+P\+O\+S\+I\+T\+E} to support analog cameras and what not
\item Fixed {\ttfamily \hyperlink{class_face_recognition}{Face\+Recognition}} sample (issue \#188)

\item Increased versatility of {\ttfamily Ipl\+Image.\+create\+From()}, {\ttfamily copy\+From()}, {\ttfamily copy\+To()}, {\ttfamily get\+Buffered\+Image()} by providing a {\ttfamily flip\+Channels} parameter, whose effect was previously mistakenly forced onto four-\/channel images of byte values only (issue \#163)
\item Fixed a couple of things with {\ttfamily Cv\+Mat.\+get()/put()} (issue \#167)
\item In addition to an {\ttfamily Ipl\+Image}, we may now specify the pixel format of the data when calling {\ttfamily F\+Fmpeg\+Frame\+Recorder.\+record()}, but otherwise when {\ttfamily Ipl\+Image.\+n\+Channels == 2}, it assumes {\ttfamily P\+I\+X\+\_\+\+F\+M\+T\+\_\+\+N\+V21}, allowing for easy and efficient encoding of data captured from the camera on Android (issue \#160), image objects we can also convert to R\+G\+B using {\ttfamily cv\+Cvt\+Color()} with {\ttfamily C\+V\+\_\+\+Y\+U\+V420sp2\+B\+G\+R}
\item Fixed seeking capabilities of {\ttfamily F\+Fmpeg\+Frame\+Grabber} (issue \#162) and added {\ttfamily get\+Length\+In\+Frames()} and {\ttfamily get\+Length\+In\+Time()} methods to query the duration of streams, when known

\item Adjusted {\ttfamily G\+N\+Image\+Aligner}, {\ttfamily Pro\+Cam\+Transformer}, etc. to support alignment of only the projector display on textureless surface planes
\item Renamed a few more {\ttfamily Settings} properties to reflect better their meanings
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{February 18, 2012}


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\item Fixed and enhanced {\ttfamily G\+N\+Image\+Aligner\+C\+L} and {\ttfamily Projector\+Device} (its {\ttfamily use\+Open\+G\+L} property) to support fully Open\+C\+L and Open\+G\+L acceleration
\item Refactored {\ttfamily Parallel} a bit so that we may set the number of threads it uses via its static {\ttfamily num\+Threads} property or the \char`\"{}com.\+googlecode.\+javacv.\+numthreads\char`\"{} system property, which defaults to {\ttfamily Parallel.\+get\+Num\+Cores() = Runtime.\+get\+Runtime().available\+Processors()}
\item Cleaned up and renamed some methods in {\ttfamily Java\+C\+V}, while adding {\ttfamily bounding\+Rect()}, functionally similar to {\ttfamily cv\+Bounding\+Rect}, but better adapted to compute a properly aligned and padded R\+O\+I

\item {\ttfamily Canvas\+Frame}, {\ttfamily Frame\+Grabber}, {\ttfamily Frame\+Recorder}, and {\ttfamily Projective\+Device} objects now throw {\ttfamily Exception} objects of a nested class instead of the too generic {\ttfamily java.\+lang.\+Exception} one
\item Moved parallel execution of {\ttfamily cvkernels.\+multi\+Warp\+Color\+Transform()}, modifying {\ttfamily Image\+Transformer} classes, from {\ttfamily G\+N\+Image\+Aligner} into {\ttfamily cvkernels}, which now also supports other image types than {\ttfamily float}

\item Removed {\ttfamily trigger\+Flush\+Size} property from {\ttfamily Camera\+Device} and {\ttfamily Frame\+Grabber}, instead relying on the {\ttfamily num\+Buffers} property to decide the required size of a buffer flush
\item Corrected the logic behind {\ttfamily F\+Fmpeg\+Frame\+Grabber.\+get\+Frame\+Rate()} and {\ttfamily get\+Timestamp()} (issue \#151)
\item Created a {\ttfamily Buffer\+Ring} class for convenient circular rings of large buffers that require manual release of resources, such as Open\+C\+L memory
\item Added a few more useful methods to {\ttfamily Frame\+Grabber}, including {\ttfamily restart()}, {\ttfamily flush()}, and {\ttfamily delayed\+Grab()} (to be used in conjunction with {\ttfamily get\+Delayed\+Time()} and {\ttfamily get\+Delayed\+Image()})
\item Inserted {\ttfamily cv\+Load\+Image\+B\+G\+R\+A()} and {\ttfamily cv\+Load\+Image\+R\+G\+B\+A()} methods into {\ttfamily opencv\+\_\+highgui} to load color images compatible with Open\+C\+L more easily
\item {\ttfamily Java\+Cv\+Error\+Callback} now outputs messages to {\ttfamily Logger} instead of {\ttfamily System.\+err}
\item Defined {\ttfamily V\+I\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+\_\+\+M\+U\+L\+T\+I\+\_\+\+T\+H\+R\+E\+A\+D\+E\+D} for {\ttfamily video\+Input}, allowing it to run on multiple threads if needed
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{January 8, 2012}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Java\+C\+V should now have an easier time automatically finding libraries inside standard directories such as {\ttfamily /usr/local/lib/}, {\ttfamily /opt/local/lib/}, and {\ttfamily C\+:\textbackslash{}opencv\textbackslash{}}, even when they are not part of the system configuration or P\+A\+T\+H (issue \#127)

\item Renamed {\ttfamily Frame\+Grabber.\+Color\+Mode} to {\ttfamily Image\+Mode} and its {\ttfamily B\+G\+R} value to {\ttfamily C\+O\+L\+O\+R} to reflect the fact that a {\ttfamily Frame\+Grabber} instance can return color images in some arbitrary format, but added a new {\ttfamily pixel\+Format} property to let users know or specify the exact pixel format desired, such as {\ttfamily P\+I\+X\+\_\+\+F\+M\+T\+\_\+\+B\+G\+R24}, etc. in the case of {\ttfamily F\+Fmpeg\+Frame\+Grabber}
\item After {\ttfamily F\+Fmpeg\+Frame\+Grabber.\+start()}, the {\ttfamily format}, {\ttfamily image\+Width}, {\ttfamily image\+Height}, and {\ttfamily frame\+Rate} properties switch to their effective values

\item Readded to {\ttfamily K\+D\+Tree}, {\ttfamily Index}, and {\ttfamily H\+O\+G\+Descriptor} some functions with {\ttfamily Float\+Pointer} and {\ttfamily Int\+Pointer} arguments that were mistakenly removed when Open\+C\+V switched to using {\ttfamily cv\+::\+Input\+Array} and {\ttfamily cv\+::\+Output\+Array} parameter types (issue \#134)
\item Renamed {\ttfamily Projective\+Gain\+Bias\+Transformer} to {\ttfamily Projective\+Color\+Transformer}
\item Added a few classes to do some processing using Open\+C\+L and Open\+G\+L\+: {\ttfamily Java\+C\+V\+C\+L}, {\ttfamily G\+N\+Image\+Aligner\+C\+L}, {\ttfamily Projective\+Transformer\+C\+L}, {\ttfamily Projective\+Color\+Transformer\+C\+L}, and {\ttfamily Pro\+Cam\+Transformer\+C\+L} with some other related files
\item Renamed {\ttfamily Parallel.\+num\+Cores} to the more conventional {\ttfamily Parallel.\+N\+U\+M\+\_\+\+C\+O\+R\+E\+S}
\item Added new {\ttfamily Face\+Recognition.\+java} sample from Stephen L. Reed
\item Inserted a couple of missing calls to {\ttfamily Loader.\+load()} (issue \#142)
\item Improved hacks for {\ttfamily Loader.\+load()} in Java\+C\+P\+P make Java\+C\+V work on Android 4.\+0

\item Added missing allocator to {\ttfamily Cv\+R\+N\+G}
\item {\ttfamily Open\+C\+V\+Frame\+Grabber} now detects when C\+V\+\_\+\+C\+A\+P\+\_\+\+P\+R\+O\+P\+\_\+\+P\+O\+S\+\_\+\+M\+S\+E\+C is broken and gives up calling {\ttfamily cv\+Get\+Capture\+Property()}
\item New {\ttfamily Open\+Kinect\+Frame\+Grabber.\+grab\+Depth()} and {\ttfamily grab\+Video()} methods to capture \char`\"{}depth\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}video\char`\"{} simultaneously, regardless of the mode
\end{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{May 11, 2011}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed {\ttfamily Cv\+Mat} object pooling in favor of more efficient {\ttfamily Thread\+Local} objects created by {\ttfamily Cv\+Mat.\+create\+Thread\+Local()}
\item Changed {\ttfamily Marker.\+get\+Center()} back to the centroid, because it has better noise averaging properties and gives in practice more accurate results than the actual center

\item New {\ttfamily video\+Input\+Lib} wrapper and corresponding {\ttfamily Video\+Input\+Frame\+Grabber} to capture using Direct\+Show, useful under Windows 7 where Open\+C\+V and F\+Fmpeg can fail to capture using Video for Windows (issue \#58)
\item {\ttfamily Geometric\+Calibrator} now reports the maximum errors in addition to the average (R\+M\+S) errors
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{April 7, 2011}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a {\ttfamily format} property to {\ttfamily Camera\+Device}, {\ttfamily Frame\+Grabber}, and {\ttfamily Frame\+Recorder}, mostly useful for {\ttfamily F\+Fmpeg\+Frame\+Grabber}, where interesting values include \char`\"{}dv1394\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}mjpeg\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}video4linux2\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}vfwcap\char`\"{}, and \char`\"{}x11grab\char`\"{}
\item {\ttfamily Open\+C\+V\+Frame\+Recorder} now uses {\ttfamily C\+V\+\_\+\+F\+O\+U\+R\+C\+C\+\_\+\+P\+R\+O\+M\+P\+T} under Windows as default since {\ttfamily C\+V\+\_\+\+F\+O\+U\+R\+C\+C\+\_\+\+D\+E\+F\+A\+U\+L\+T} crashes (issue \#49)
\item Added hack to make sure the temporarily extracted library files get properly deleted under Windows
\item Java\+C\+P\+P now loads classes more lazily

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{February 19, 2011}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Switched from J\+N\+A to Java\+C\+P\+P, which has a lower overhead and supports C++, bringing hope that future versions of Java\+C\+V will support features of Open\+C\+V available only through the C++ A\+P\+I
\item Consequently, the syntax of various operations have changed a bit, but the transition should not be too painful
\item As a happier consequence, this also fixes the problem with S\+S\+E instructions on 32-\/bit x86 (issue \#36)
\item Also, Java\+C\+P\+P does not have any limitations or performance issues with large data structures (issue \#10 and issue \#14)
\item Added support for Open\+C\+V 2.\+2 (issue \#42), but dropped support for all previous versions
\item Added samples provided by users (issue \#1, issue \#45, and issue \#46)
\item Added deinterlace setting to {\ttfamily F\+Fmpeg\+Frame\+Grabber} having it call {\ttfamily avpicture\+\_\+deinterlace()} (issue \#38)
\item Enhanced a few things of the image alignment algorithm
\item Tried to fix image format conversion inside {\ttfamily Fly\+Capture\+Frame\+Grabber}, but this is going to require more careful debugging

\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{December 2, 2010}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Now works on Android with the Dalvik V\+M (for more details, please refer to the Face\+Preview sample available on the download page)

\item Fixed version specific declarations of {\ttfamily Cv\+Stereo\+B\+M\+State} and related functions
\item Fixed conditions that could crash {\ttfamily cvkernels}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{November 4, 2010}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Renamed the package namespace to {\ttfamily com.\+googlecode.\+javacv}, which makes more sense now that Java\+C\+V has been well anchored at Google Code for more than a year, piggybacking on the unique and easy-\/to-\/remember domain name
\item Included new F\+Fmpeg wrapper classes {\ttfamily avutil}, {\ttfamily avcodec}, {\ttfamily avformat}, {\ttfamily avdevice}, {\ttfamily avfilter}, {\ttfamily postprocess}, and {\ttfamily swscale}, eliminating the need of the separate F\+Fmpeg-\/\+Java package
\item {\ttfamily Canvas\+Frame} now redraws its {\ttfamily Canvas} after the user resizes the {\ttfamily Frame}
\item Fixed the {\ttfamily Error} thrown when calling {\ttfamily Canvas\+Frame.\+show\+Image()} from the E\+D\+T

\item Made sweeping changes (for the better, but still not finalized) to {\ttfamily G\+N\+Image\+Aligner}, {\ttfamily Projective\+Transformer}, {\ttfamily Projective\+Gain\+Bias\+Transformer}, and {\ttfamily Pro\+Cam\+Transformer}...
\item Added to {\ttfamily Java\+C\+V} more methods related to transformation of planes\+: {\ttfamily perspective\+Transform()}, {\ttfamily get\+Plane\+Parameters()}, {\ttfamily get\+Perspective\+Transform()}, and {\ttfamily Hto\+Rt()}, as well as {\ttfamily Projective\+Device.\+get\+Fronto\+Parallel\+H()}
\item Added a static {\ttfamily auto\+Synch} flag to all {\ttfamily Structure} classes of {\ttfamily cxcore}, {\ttfamily cv}, and {\ttfamily cvaux}, which you may set to {\ttfamily false} prior to the return of things like big and heavy {\ttfamily Cv\+Seq} to make them load faster and to avoid stack overflows, but accessing fields will then require manual calls to {\ttfamily read\+Field()} and {\ttfamily write\+Field()} (issue \#10 and \#14)
\item Added missing {\ttfamily By\+Value} subclasses to {\ttfamily Cv\+Seq}, {\ttfamily Cv\+Set}, {\ttfamily Cv\+Contour\+Tree}, and {\ttfamily Cv\+Chain}... Any others missing?
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Exception} thrown from {\ttfamily cv\+Create\+Hist()} under J\+N\+A 3.\+2.\+7 (issue \#26)
\item Enhanced {\ttfamily Cv\+Mat.\+put()}, which now supports setting submatrices

\item Added {\ttfamily Java\+C\+V.\+median()} function, and {\ttfamily Java\+C\+V.\+fractal\+Triangle\+Wave()} now respects image R\+O\+I
\item Fixed background subtraction in {\ttfamily cvaux}
\item Fixed crash inside the code for direct alignment caused by the R\+O\+I getting set outside the image plane
\item Added {\ttfamily delta\+Scale} and {\ttfamily try\+To\+Fix\+Plane} to {\ttfamily G\+N\+Image\+Aligner.\+Settings} (the first used in {\ttfamily Image\+Transformer.\+Parameters} as increment, randomly selected forward or backward, for finite difference), which sometimes help to jump over local minima
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{May 30, 2010}

\item Fixed incorrect {\ttfamily Java.\+Hn\+To\+Rt()}, and added a few {\ttfamily norm()} and {\ttfamily randn()} methods
\item For functions with {\ttfamily float\mbox{[}\mbox{]}} and {\ttfamily double\mbox{[}\mbox{]}} arguments in {\ttfamily cvaux} and {\ttfamily cv}, added complementary {\ttfamily Float\+Buffer} and {\ttfamily Double\+Buffer} declarations
\item Fixed loading problems with {\ttfamily cvaux}
\item Fixed and enhanced histogram, back projection, and other C\+A\+M\+S\+H\+I\+F\+T related functionality

\item {\ttfamily Camera\+Device.\+Settings.\+trigger\+Flush\+Size} now defaults to 5 (only affects {\ttfamily Open\+C\+V\+Frame\+Grabber} and {\ttfamily F\+Fmpeg\+Frame\+Grabber})
\item Replaced {\ttfamily L\+M\+Image\+Aligner} by {\ttfamily G\+N\+Image\+Aligner}, a more appropriate name for Gauss-\/\+Newton with {\ttfamily line\+Search}
\item Fixed a few things related with {\ttfamily Projective\+Device.\+Settings}

\item {\ttfamily Camera\+Device.\+Settings} has a new {\ttfamily device\+File} property (used by a {\ttfamily Frame\+Grabber}), which brings up a file dialog for some {\ttfamily Property\+Editor}s
\item Moved in {\ttfamily Camera\+Settings}, {\ttfamily Projector\+Settings}, and {\ttfamily Frame\+Grabber.\+Property\+Editor} from the {\ttfamily procamcalib} package
\item Added to {\ttfamily Camera\+Device.\+Settings} and {\ttfamily Frame\+Grabber} a {\ttfamily trigger\+Flush\+Size} property to indicate the number of buffers to flush on {\ttfamily trigger()} to compensate for cheap cameras that keep old images in memory indefinitely

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Relicensed Java\+C\+V under the G\+P\+Lv2 with Classpath exception (see L\+I\+C\+E\+N\+S\+E.\+txt). Please note that if your application links with code that needs A\+R\+Tool\+Kit\+Plus, for example, it will become subject to the full G\+P\+L, without Classpath exception
\item Added {\ttfamily device\+Path} setting to {\ttfamily Camera\+Device} that works with {\ttfamily F\+Fmpeg\+Frame\+Grabber}, {\ttfamily Open\+C\+V\+Frame\+Grabber}, and other {\ttfamily Frame\+Grabber} with a String constructor
